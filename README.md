In this competition Kaggle encourage us to create a supervised ML model to predict loan defaults, for that propouse one table with 13 columns was provided.

The analysis contain:

1. Review of the table
2. Train validation split (80-20)

4. Pipline for data preprosesing
5. Train and validate models
   - Logistic Regression
   - Random Forest
   - Gradient descent
   - KNN
   - Esenble learning
   - Future importances
7. AUC curve

Finally the champion model was Random Forest, getting 0.62253, with that result this model finished in fourth position in the leader board
